I am an LLM Systems Researcher at ByteDance Seed. I earned my Ph.D. from Tsinghua University, advised by [Jidong Zhai](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zjd/).
My passion lies in building efficient and reliable machine learning systems, with research interests covering large-scale LLM training, compilation optimization, and long-term operations.

Projects
======
- [InfiniTensor](https://github.com/InfiniTensor/InfiniTensor) is a high-performance inference engine tailored for GPUs and AI accelerators. Its design focuses on effective deployment and swift academic validation.
- [Vapro](https://github.com/thu-pacman/VAPRO) is a performance profiler to detect and diagnose performance variance (i.e., performance degradation and jitters) for parallel applications.
